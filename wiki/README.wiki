== How to use tetris4j SVN ==

To really work on this project you need TortoiseSVN. Download and install tortoise any way you like, and checkout this project. You can also commit if you have Subversion access.

If you don't have Subversion access, you can still checkout but you can't commit (sorry). If you want SVN access you can still message me.


=== Downloading ===

Or you can just download the game in the Downloads tab. New versions will be released once in a while.

== Compiling and running tetris4j ==

You'll find a compile.bat file, which will compile and run the program when executed. Please try not to break the build ;)
